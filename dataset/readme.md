# Dataset

You can  use the dataset which we created by downloading it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zu2WTJi4GMGuWpm36h_bCjUTllmzHjuG?usp=sharing)

Alternatively, if you want to do the heavy lifting of preparing the dataset by yourself, download the images and annotations from http://salicon.net/download/
then use the code in the [data-prepare](/data-prepare) folder to generate the heatmaps in form of images.
